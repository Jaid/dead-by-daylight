{flavor:You are fuelled by your hate for progress.}

Overcharge a Generator by performing the Damage Generator action.
The next Survivor interacting with that generator is faced with a tremendously difficult Skill Check.
Failing the Skill Check results in an additional {tiers:3%/4%/5%} generator regression.
Succeeding the Skill Check grants no progress but prevents the Generator explosion.
