Hold down the Power Bjtton to Charge Vile Purge. Releasing the button unleashes a stream of unfectious bile.

A Survivor hit by the stream becomes infected. A Survivor accumulates an amount of infection by being hit by the stream, running, or performing interactions. Environmental objects also become infected for a short duration when hit by the stream.

If the Survivor's infection indicator is completely filled, the Survivor is forced to vomit, and continues to do so at random intervals; they become injured, if they are not already, and gain the Broken status effect; and, they pass on their infection to other Survivors, as well as evironmental objects that they interact with.

Infected Survivors can remove all infection by interacting with a Pool of Devotion. This blocks it from further use by other Survivors. If The Survivor is injured, they become healthy. It all Pools of Devotion are corrupted at the same time, all Pools of Devotion revert to their clean state.

{plague} may consume the corruption at a Pool of Devotion that has previously been used by a Survivor. This remove the corruption from the pool and transforms Vile Purge into Corrupt Purge. Corrupt Purge instantly damages any Survivors hit by the stream but does not apply infection. This effect only lasts for a short duration.
