{legion} has a Frenzy power gauge that builds up over time. Once the gauge is full, Feral Frenzy can be activated by napping the Power button. While power gauge drains rapidly and the power ends when the gauge is empty, triggering an extended recovery cooldown:

When activating Feral Frenzy, {legion} enters a deadly rage. While the power is active:

• {legion} sprints faster than base movement speed.
• {legion} can vault pallets but cannot break them.
• Survivors' scratch marks and blood pools are hidden from The Killer's view.
• Missing an attack ends Feral Frenzy.

While Feral Frenzy is active, hitting a Survivor who is not currently afflicted with the Deep Wound status effect:

• Applies the Deep Wound status effect.
• Injures the Survivor, if they are not already injured.
• Refills The Killer's entire power gauge.
• Triggers 'Killer Instinct', revealing the location of all Survivors who do not have the Deep Wound status effect applied and are within The Killer's Terror Radius.

While Feral Frenzy is active, hitting a Survivor who is currently afflicted with the Deep Wound status effect or missing an attack:

• Depletes The Killer's entire power gauge and ends the power immediately.

Hitting a Survivor with a basic attack while Feral Frenzy is not active will deplete the power gauge by half of its maximum.
