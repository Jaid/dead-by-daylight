- Disabled all Moon Bouquet (lightest / darkest moonlight) offerings
- Added the ability to unlock perks in Bloodweb levels 2, 3 and 4
- Adjusted the speed thresholds to hit a running vault (fast vault). They should now be more consistent. To hit a running vault, make sure to run straight at the window with at least 2.5 meters of clearance.
- Added new interaction prompt text for the running vault to make it more clear when to hit the input. It's pretty quick, so keep your eyes peeled. (Herman Carter laughs in the distance)
- Adjusted the spawning rules to reduce the possibility for Survivors to spawn next to a Killer
- Time to hook a survivor reduced from 2 seconds to 1.5 seconds. The hooking animation has been updated.
- for: spirit
  text: "{spirit}'s phasing audio has been adjusted: Survivors within the spirit Husk's terror radius will not hear the phasing sound. Survivors outside the Spirit Husk's terror radius can hear {spirit}'s phasing sound, but will not be able to determine its direction. Survivors will no longer be able to hear {spirit}'s breathing while she is phasing."
- for: hag, nightmare, pig, shape, spirit, wraith
  text: Adjusted the footstep audio for the stealthier and smaller Killers ({hag}, {nightmare}, {pig}, {shape}, {spirit} and {wraith})
- The minimum and maximum hook rules no longer define a random range. They now specify a minimum number of hooks to spawn and a maximum that is allowed to spawn
- Hooks will now spawn at least 20 meters away from each other (unless the minimum is not reached, no two hooks will be closer than 20 meters).
- The effects of the Petrified Oak, Moldy Oak, Rotten Oak and Putrid Oak Offerings have changed. They now apply a modifier to the minimum and maximum hooks allowed.
- Tweaked the Pallet Density for each map. The minimum distance between pallets are now either 14m, 16m, 18m or 20m.
- Hill Totems are now better hidden.
- Added a few extra hook spawn points to various building tiles to improve the hook spawn pool which was too restricted.
- In The Game map, slightly moved or re-positioned pallets to increase their visibility.
- In The Game map, a new corner tile may appear with a maze on the bottom floor.
- In The Game map, set the minimum number of pallets to 15.
- In Haddonfield, all short fences (white picket fences and hedge fences) have holes in them. Only tall fences can completely enclose a yard.
- In Lery's Memorial Institute, fixed a situation where two windows leading from the treatment room could spawn at the same time.
- In Coldwind Farm maps, reworked the Slaughter Tree. Made the loop smol and added a blocker in front of the vault to give the loop a preferred direction.
- In Pale Rose, made the layout smaller and moved the Shrimp Boat tile.
- In Grim Pantry, made the layout smaller and added a Dock tile.
- Added a hook to the top floor of the Thompson House.
- Improved the consistency of flashlight target zones for each Killer (aim at the head!).
- Improved flashlight feedback to make it clearer when the blind effect is being applied, and when a successful flashlight blind occurs.
- Reworked the flashlight blind effect that the Killer experiences in first person view (no longer a blindingly pure white-screen effect). New VFX are also applicable for Survivors being blinded with a firecracker item.
- To give killers the ability to extend the game length through regular gameplay and without increasing generator times, the base time to heal is being increased.
- Increased the base heal time from 12 seconds to 16 seconds
- "Mangled Status Effect: Reduced the modifier strength from -25% to -20%. Mangled will now increase healing time from 16 seconds to 20 seconds."
- Medkits and their add-ons have had their charges increased to match the new charges required for one heal (from 12 to 16)
- The recover cap has been increased from 85% to 95%.
- Recover action speed has been increased from 40% to 50%. Recover is a form of healing, and is affected by the base healing time change. It now takes 30.4 seconds to recover to a maximum of 95%. (It previously took 25.5 seconds to recover to a maximum of 85%)
- "Toolbox Sabotage: Removed efficiency penalty. Previously, sabotaging with a toolbox would use 3 charges per second from that toolbox. Seeing as sabotage is no longer permanent, this efficiency penalty has been removed."
- for: saboteur
  text: "Seeing as toolbox sabotage no longer suffers from an item efficiency penalty, {saboteur}'s toolbox sabotage efficiency bonus has been removed. {saboteur} now causes hooks and traps sabotaged by that player to stay sabotaged for an extra {tiers:10/20/30} seconds."
- Event specific hooks can no longer be sabotaged by Survivors.
- "Devout: Hooking all Survivors at least once in a Trial each awards a minimum of Bronze quality in this Emblem."
- "Chaser: Remaining within a close (16 meters) proximity of a hooked Survivor will reduce the quality of this Emblem over time. Being within 8m greatly increases this penalty. This penalty is not applied for the first 10 seconds after a Survivor is hooked. If the Killer is currently in a chase OR there are 1 or more other Survivors within a 16m radius of the hooked Survivor, the penalty is not applied. If the hooked Survivor is the last remaining Survivor in a match, the penalty is not applied."
