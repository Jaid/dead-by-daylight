    - "Chaser Scoring: The proximity penalty has been increased. The longer a Killer stays within a close proximity (16m) to a hooked Survivor, the more points they will lose in the Chaser emblem."
    - "Devout Scoring: The scoring thresholds have been modified. 3 kills now also result in a Silver emblem, whereas 4 kills results in Gold. To earn an Iridescent Devout emblem, you need to perform 10 or more hook events and sacrifice all 4 Survivors."
    - "Gatekeeper Scoring: The scoring formula has been adjusted completely. Killers earn incremental points based on how few generators have been completed, each minute for the first nine minutes of the match - regardless of how long the match takes. The longer the gens are not completed, the more points they are worth. At the end of the match, the Killer also gains bonus points based on how few generators have been completed. Note: If the match is over before nine minutes is up, they receive points for the remaining minutes (up to nine) based on how few generators had been completed at the end of the match."
