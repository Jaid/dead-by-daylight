- Added a new map for the Red Forest theme (The Temple of Purgation).
- Added the matchmaking queue time display for both roles. This change follows the backend matchmaking changes (addition of queues) that were recently deployed.
- Adjusted the EULA & Privacy Policy approval flow, and added an option to revoke the consent from the settings menu.
- Changed the Character Swap controls from LT/RT to LS/RS
- Disabled changing the active characters with the Character Swap controls while the player is Ready in a lobby. This was done as an extra check to ensure there are no more accidental character swaps.
- Integrated an updated version of the Unreal Engine (4.21, from 4.20).
- "Modified the progression display for certain Daily Rituals. Instead of showing the percentage and minutes, we're now showing the amount and seconds. This is applicable for the following Daily Rituals: Blood Dance, *Reconstruction Ritual, Rite of Ruin, Wild Dance, and Hunt Ritual."
- This update also contains some additional optimizations for all platforms
