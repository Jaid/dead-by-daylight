- Added extra hooks spawning spots around certain buildings to improve hook distribution.
- "Backwater Swamp: Adjusted height of bulrushes."
- "Backwater Swamp: Increased the spawning probability of the hooks in the center portion of the map to prioritize this portion of the map in favor of the edges."
- "Badham Preschool: Now forcing a hook to spawn in the back of the preschool school if the basement is not there."
- Changed the basement reference point (used to calculate hook to basement distance) to the top of the basement stairs instead of being in the middle of the basement.
- "Grim Pantry: Added a new crow bomb to the map."
- for: pig
  text: Procedural System - Added a minimum distance between chests so that jigsaw boxes don't spawn too close together.
- "Procedural System - Hook distribution adjustments: changed the amount and distribution of hooks for each map. Every map now has a baseline minimum distance between hooks, a minimum number of hooks and a maximum number of hooks. Procedural System - Hook offerings now modify the newly introduced minimum distance between hooks. This distance will ultimately be ignored in the case where the minimum number of hooks requirements are not fulfilled. The effect of each offering is as such: Moldy Oak (Uncommon) = -1.5m, Rotten Oak (Rare)= -2.5m, Putrid Oak (Very Rare) = -3.5m, Petrified Oak (Survivor Very Rare) = +1m."
- Reduced basement to hook minimum distance to 16 meters.
- "The Game: Added a few extra signs to help players navigate to the stairs."
- "Totem placement improvements: Recent upgrades to the totem interaction method allows the level design team to place the totems closer to other objects and as such, totem placement and hiding spots will be continuously improved starting with this update."

- All status effects that are timer based no longer stack or automatically reset the timer, but rather, take the highest remaining status timer and ignore the other.
- If the new timer is the higher one, the previous timer is discarded and the status effect icon will visually reset to 100%. If the new timer is the lower one, the new timer is discarded and the status effect icon remains at its current progression.

- "Item Interaction: Items found in chests without already holding an item now require being picked up. This makes the interaction consistent with when you have an item already in hand and allows you to see what you have found before you commit to picking it up."
- "Mori Icon: If The Killer has played a mori offering, the offering's icon will be displayed in the in-game HUD when the conditions are valid and they are standing over a downed Survivor."

- Adjusted the Vault mechanic so that survivors come out of the vault with momentum, instead of being set to 0 movement speed after a vault.
