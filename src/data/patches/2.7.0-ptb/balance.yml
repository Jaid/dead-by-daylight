- Adjusted controller inputs to improve movement control.
- Adjusted the time the notification bubbles are displayed to 5 seconds. This includes all notification bubbles that are not perk based; exit switch, generator, hooked, bear traps, etc.
- Boarded up the Maze walls in Coldwind Farm maps to reduce the ability to look through the tiles and see the Killers' and Survivors' movements.
- Killers do not see the Deep Wound status effect progress timer; only the Deep Wound bar to know the status effect has been applied.
- Removed hatch interrupts for the End Game Collapse.
- Removed the RNG element associated to window placement in the Treatment Theatre map. Each room now has a static window spawn configuration. RNG is now only being applied to the placement of extra openings in the rooms.
