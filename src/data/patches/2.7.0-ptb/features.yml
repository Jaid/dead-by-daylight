- Re-implemented the full translation for Traditional Chinese.
- Added a delay before the ping indicator appears in the online lobby for Killers & Survivors. This delay allows for the ping to stabilize before being displayed to the player.
- Games that would start with less than 5 players are canceled, and all players still connected to the server will be returned to the tally screen (keeping their items, add-ons and offerings) and notified about the cancellation.
- Re-added the theme music for DLC characters.

- text: Added End Game Collapse
  points:
    - Closing the hatch instantly powers up the exit gates.
    - End Game Collapse starts when an exit gate is opened or when the Killer closes the hatch.
    - End Game timer starts at 2 minutes. Timer is slowed down when a Survivor is downed or hooked.
    - Survivors are sacrificed by the Entity when the timer expires. These sacrifices count as kills.
    - The Killer can now open a powered up exit gate.
    - The hatch always spawn as soon as there is 1 Survivor left in the trial.
