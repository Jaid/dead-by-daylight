- All Killer swing animations have been modified to match the distance at which they can hit a survivor. This was done to help mitigate situations where a Killer would hit a survivor but their weapon/hand would not look like it was reaching the Survivor.
- In addition to Killer swing animations matching their hit distance we have also added swing VFX to mitigate when hits looked like they should have missed targets when in fact they found a target and hit. (There will be more work done to make hits look better when they connect)
- Added stun VFX for Killers when hit by pallets.
- Survivors will now turn their heads where their camera is looking. This happens when a Survivor interacts with an object in the environment and when they are not downed or incapacitated.
- "Adjusted fast vault conditions: Players can no longer trigger fast vaults when beside windows or in contact with the wall."

- Adjusted certain darker cosmetics that gave players an advantage to be lighter.
- Re-worked some characters hair.
- Adjusted Killer Instinct VFX to remove red fill effect, increase frequency of pulse, add an offset to where symbol is displayed, modified the scaling of the symbol to stay more consistent. These changes also affect the Killer power, Feral Frenzy, of {legion}.

- Adjusted the chase volume for Survivors.

- Removed the RNG factor from the window setups in the rooms of Lery's Memorial Institute; each small room now spawns with the same window configuration.
- Edge Object repopulation pass in The MacMillan Estate maps, there are more obstacles in between the map tiles now.
- Introduced new maze tiles for the Yamaoka Estate theme.

  text: We have changed the condition for getting tokens. It is no longer for being hit by a Killer's basic attack. Instead earn tokens by taking "Protection Hits". It still requires 3 tokens to activate. Survivors will still need to be injured in order to trigger the Endurance effect and avoid being put into the dying state. This means that {mettleOfMan} will require more work from the Survivor to trigger {mettleOfMan}'s Endurance status effect.
