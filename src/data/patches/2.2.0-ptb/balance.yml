- Hover over each Emblem to see the activities and actions that contributed (both positively and negatively) toward your final Emblem result.
- Scoring criteria and Emblem results breakdown have been added to the post-match Emblem screen.
- The values represent the percentage of points you gained towards reaching the Iridescent Emblem threshold (100%), however, it is possible to receive an Emblem result with an overall percentage greater than 100%.
- This Emblem results breakdown is intended to give more clarity and transparency to the resulting outcome, and reduce the confusion and frustration that some players feel when they receive unexpected results.
