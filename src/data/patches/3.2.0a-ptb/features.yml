- text: Added 2 new Status Effects
  points:
    - Oblivious (Survivor) and Undetectable (Killer). Currently, these status effects are applied to the new Killer, {demogorgon}, and {nightmare}.
    - "Oblivious: The Survivor is oblivious to the imminent danger of a nearby Killer. They do not hear The Killer's terror radius and they are not considered as being within the terror radius for power or perk effects."
    - "Undetectable: The Killer enters a stealth-like mode which suppresses their red stain and terror radius, and blocks all Survivor aura-reading abilities."
